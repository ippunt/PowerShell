$_ Is a temp variable for each object piped in. People generally think the period is associated but that is to access the object property.  
get-eventlog -log security | where-object {$_.EventID -match 4625} | sort-object -property TimeGenerated | select-object -last 10 
Used because you want to loop through each object and check EventID. Less strict alternative 

get-eventlog -log security "4625"| sort-object -property TimeGenerated | select-object -last 10; May cause false positives.  

1..3  the .. operator counts all the numbers inbetween. Each number on its own line. \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n.
